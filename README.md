## Repo Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to improve my documentation skills, learn Terraform best practices, and explore aspects of infrastructure as code (IaC). Through this journey, I aim to upskill in DevOps tools and enhance my understanding of Terraform.

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can manage and version your infrastructure efficiently, providing a reliable and scalable way to deploy and update resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments.

## Why Terraform?
Terraform has gained popularity in the industry for several reasons:
- **Multi-Cloud Support:** Terraform supports various cloud providers, enabling users to manage resources across different platforms.
- **Declarative Syntax:** The declarative configuration language used in Terraform allows users to describe the desired state of their infrastructure, and Terraform handles the execution details.
- **Community and Industry Standards:** Terraform has a vibrant community, extensive documentation, and is widely adopted in the industry, making it a valuable skill for DevOps and infrastructure professionals.

## Progress
Here's an example of the progress I have made in the Terraform journey:
